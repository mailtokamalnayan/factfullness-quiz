# Measure your factfulness

Every now and then I'm inspired by books that change the way I think. One of the books that recently affected my thinking was — [Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About The World - And Why Things Are Better Than You Think](https://amzn.to/2vse4Ib)

The book starts with few basic questions regarding world — i.e, how many people in the world have access to electricity etc... The questionnaire acts as a resounding proof of how wrong and ignorant we are about the world. This app is an attempt to encourage more people to answer those questions and become more aware of their ignorance.
